# Machine-learning
## Categoruies
- regression ( supervised ) - how much prodects we be sold ?
- classification ( supervised ) - detect cat/dog
- clusters ( unsupervised ) 

## Algorithms 
- decision tree
- neural networks ( deep learning )
- regression
- kmeans (clusters)
- bayesian 

## creating model


## ML options on AWS 
1) managed and trained 
models already trained 
can tweak models


2) managed  - sagemaker 
can create model
no control on the infrastructure 

3) self managed 
full control on everything
special pre configured AMIS with support to relevant platforms like pytorch , Tensorflow ,Keras 

### AWS DLAMI
Deep learning AMI

- DLAMI with Conda - all frameworks are installed 
- Base AMI ( advanced )

for learning use p2.xlarge ( c4.xlarge as alternative) 
for adcance use case use other GPU instnace / FPGA/ AWS inferentia 

eia1.large eia1.meduim - accelarator for elastic inference
