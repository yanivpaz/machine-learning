models already trained 
can tweak models


2) managed  - sagemaker 
can create model
no control on the infrastructure 

3) self managed

special pre configured AMIS with support to relevant platforms like pytorch , Tensorflow ,Keras 

## DLAMI
Deep learning AMI

- DLAMI with Conda - all frameworks are installed 
- Base AMI ( advanced )

for learning use p2.xlarge ( c4.xlarge as alternative) 
for adcance use case use other GPU instnace / FPGA/ AWS inferentia
